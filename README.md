# Opinion Dynamics Visualization

This project explores the complex nature of opinion formation and evolution within a population, incorporating computational social science models and GPT-3 to simulate interactions between agents, represented as individuals with multifaceted opinions. The project visualizes the nuanced evolution of opinions within a network, providing an intuitive and interactive interface in a Jupyter notebook.

## Objective
The primary goal is to study and visualize the intricate process of opinion dynamics and to understand how interactions between individual agents lead to the evolution of opinions within a population over time. By leveraging models from computational social science and the advanced natural language understanding of GPT-3, the project aims to render more realistic and nuanced agent dialogues, shedding light on the multifaceted nature of opinion formation and convergence.

## Overview
1. **opinion_dynamics.py**
   - **Agent Class:** Represents individual agents endowed with continuous, multidimensional opinions.
   - **Population Class:** Orchestrates a collection of agents and supervises their interactions and opinion updates.
   - **Initialization Functions:** Initialize agents with random initial opinions.
   - **Evolve Method:** Implements interaction rules to simulate opinion dynamics and updates the agents' opinions following the predetermined interaction model.

2. **opinion_viz.py**
   - Manages the visualization of opinion dynamics, utilizing Matplotlib to represent the evolution graphically.

3. **gpt_interface.py**
   - Interfaces with the GPT-3 API to generate realistic agent dialogues.
   - Provides functions to prompt GPT-3 with context and to process the retrieved responses.

4. **analysis.py**
   - Houses functions to study various aspects like opinion convergence, cluster formations, opinion polarities, and evaluates the complexity and variety of the texts generated by GPT-3.

5. **opinion_dynamics_notebook.ipynb**
   - Acts as the central hub for the project, allowing users to generate, study, and visualize opinion dynamics, adjust model parameters, and gain insights into the opinion evolution process.

## Theoretical Context
The project's theoretical foundation is based on models from computational social science studying opinion dynamics, such as the Deffuant Model and Hegselmann-Krause Model, to simulate how opinions evolve through interactions over time. V1 is built with the Deffuant Model.

Deffuant Model 
The Deffuant Model works as follows:

- At each time step, two agents are randomly selected.
- If the difference in their opinions is smaller than a certain threshold, they will influence each other.
- They adjust their opinions towards each other by a fixed percentage.


## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory and launch the Jupyter notebook (`opinion_dynamics_notebook.ipynb`).
3. Run the cells to initialize the model, simulate interactions, and visualize the results.
